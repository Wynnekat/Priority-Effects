## Overview

### **The role of temporal dispersal patterns in building diverse tallgrass prairie plant communities**

**Background**: 

Establishing diverse plant communities is critical since diversity is linked to ecosystem health. However, recreating tallgrass prairies with high plant diversity has been challenging, especially for early-season species. Variation in species arrival may influence plant community composition and diversity. Since prairies exhibit temporal patterns of seed dispersal, planting all species simultaneously could forgo phenological differences that promote species coexistence. Therefore, we investigated whether manipulating plant species' arrival according to natural dispersal phenology influences reconstruction outcomes.  

In 2021, we manipulated the arrival of 36 species via seed additions of (i) species in the order of peak dispersal timing, (ii) summer dispersing species (first peak in dispersal activity before September 1st) followed by 18 fall dispersing species, (iii) 18 fall dispersing species followed by 18 summer dispersing species, (iv) all species simultaneously. Additionally, we had a negative control that had no seed additions. One year later, we found that differences in seeding treatment influenced the diversity and composition of reconstructed communities. Species arriving later had less cover than when seeded with priority, particularly for summer dispersing species. Overall, our study provides evidence of priority effects in reconstructed grasslands and suggests that the timing of seed additions post-disturbance influences restoration outcomes.

## Overall Setup {.tabset}

**Materials and Methods**

*Study Site*

Our experiment utilized a former agricultural field (~1 acre) at the University of Missouri’s Bradford Research Center in Columbia, MO (38.893604, -92.201154, Boone County, MO). Typical for the central U.S., the 10-year (2011 – 2021) mean annual precipitation and average air temperature at Bradford Research Center were 927.74 $\pm$ 143.01 mm and 12.40 $\pm$ 10.45 $\circ$C, respectively (Commercial Agriculture Automated Weather Station Network, d.n.). Prior to our experiment, the field we grew herbicide-resistant soybeans for at least three years, reflecting conditions similar to most prairie reconstructions before seeding (Rowe, 2010; Newbold et al., 2019). In March 2021, we tilled our study site and hand-removed rhizome clumps to create a smooth surface before our first seeding. 


*Experimental Design*

We used seed additions to manipulate the arrival of 36 native tallgrass prairie plant species. Since prairies experience two peaks in dispersal activity (Rabinowitz & Rapp 1980), we classified species into two dispersal guilds, summer-dispersing species (first peak in dispersal activity before September 1st) and fall-dispersing species. Dispersal guild is more informative than flowering guild because dispersal does not always follow flowering (e.g., Penstemon digitalis). We based our classifications on expert opinion from the Missouri Department of Conservation, The Nature Conservancy, and our previous work on seed rain patterns in Missouri tallgrass prairies (Wynne et al. *in prep*). Species used in our study consisted of 29 native species captured in our previous study on seed rain and seven summer-dispersing species that restoration managers cited as having minimal success in prairie reconstructions (e.g., Viola pedatifida) (Table S1) (Barak et al., 2022). When possible, we obtained seeds from local ecotype commercial sellers. However, several summer-dispersing species were not grown commercially in Missouri and were sourced elsewhere. We stored the seeds in a refrigerator (2.78 $\circ$C) until seeding. 

We used a randomized factorial block design to test the effects of seeding timing and order (Fig. 1). Each block (n = 6) contained five plots (2 x 2 m) randomly assigned a seed addition treatment following one of the four arrival treatments:

1)	the addition of species in order of first peak in dispersal activity (NAT)

        - May 24th 2021 (VIOPED, PACPLA)
        - June 4th 2021 (SISCAM, SPHOBT, CORLAN)
        - June 22nd 2021 (LOBSPI, TRAOHI, CARBUS, HEURIC)
        - July 11th 2021 (CORPAL, DODMEA)
        - July 25th 2021 (KOEMAC, AMOCAN)
        - August 2nd 2021 (LINSUL, MELVIR)
        - August 21st 2021 (DALCAN, DALPUR, ACHMIL)
        - September 17th 2021 (CROSAG)
        - October 4th 2021 (CHAFAS, MONFIS, RATPIN, SPOHET, RUDHIR)
        - October 18th 2021 (BIDARI, HELMOL, LESCAP)
        - November 1st 2021 (PENDIG, ERYYUC, HYPPUN, SORNUT, SCHSCO, LIAPYC)
        - November 19th 2021 (CORTRI, PYCTEN, SOLRIG)
      

2)	the lumped addition of 18 summer-dispersing species on March 22nd, 2021 followed by a lumped addition of 18 fall-dispersing species approximately five months later on September 5th, 2021 (**LE**)


3) the lumped addition of 18 fall-dispersing species on March 22nd, 2021 followed by a lumped addition of 18 summer-dispersing species approximately five months later on September 5th, 2021 (**LL**)

4) the simultaneous addition of the entire species pool on March 22nd, 2021 typical of most prairie reconstructions (**SIM**).

Additionally, we had an unseeded negative control (NON) to determine whether active seeding treatments improved community diversity compared to passive regeneration from ambient seed sources (e.g., seed rain and soil seed bank). We also seeded white clover (*Trifolium repens*) between the experimental plots to prevent erosion. In fall 2022, we started annually removing invading white clover and woody species from plots. All other unseeded species were not weeded to better reflect realistic assembly and reconstruction processes.

We started seeding at the end of the dormant season (March 22nd, 2021) and continued until November 19th, 2021. We hand-seeded species into experimental plots at a density of 50 seeds $m^{-2}$  using sand as a broadcasting agent.  For treatments requiring multiple seedings, we incorporated M-Binder tackifier (Ecology Controls, Carpinteria, CA), a natural adhesive often used in hydroseeding, into the seeding mixes to increase soil-seed contact without disturbing the existing vegetation.  After seeding, we lightly watered plots to activate the tackifier. All plots received equal amounts of sand, tackifier, and water during every seeding.

*Data Collection*

Starting in 2022, we conducted floristic surveys to assess plant community diversity and composition in experimental plots for two years. To determine species abundance, we measured the percent aerial cover of all vascular plant species rooted within a 1 $m^{2}$ subplot in the center of the experimental plot. Because many seeded summer-dispersing species senesce before peak biomass (August – September), we measured vegetative cover twice yearly, once in the early summer (late June) and again at peak biomass (late August). We only used the highest percent cover value for species present in both surveys. We identified species according to Yatskievych (1999, 2006, 2013). Additionally, we measured environmental variables including percent bare ground cover and light levels in plots.  For each plot, we measured light levels using a (**insert name of light bar**) two times above the vegetation, in the midstory, and ground-level at solar noon $\pm$ 2 hours.

## Question 1: Does timing of species arrival influence local diversity? {.tabset}


### Setup and Data Management

*Data Analysis*


We fit mixed-effects linear models with block as a random effect to determine whether year, timing of species arrival via seeding treatments, and the interaction between year and seeding treatments influenced local diversity (i.e., species richness, mean conservatism value, and Shannon diversity index) in reconstructed tallgrass prairie plant communities. In cases where random effect variance was estimated as near zero, we dropped the random effect and fit a simpler linear model instead. For each diversity model, we conducted a type III analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a posthoc Tukey test to determine significant pairwise differences. 

      
Below is the code used to calculate the species richness, mean conservatism value, and Shannon diversity index for each plot, treatment, and year combination. 

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

### Making a summary table of diversity indices between treatments

#Make a unique identifier for every block and treatment
inner_cover_max_reduced$UniqueBlock <- paste(inner_cover_max_reduced$Treatment, inner_cover_max_reduced$Block, sep="_")


### Making a community matrix

  filter(Year != "2021") %>% 
  group_by(Block, Treatment, Year, SPP6) %>% 
  summarise(max_cover = sum(max_cover))


#Make a wide formatted dataset

inner_wide <- inner_cover_max_reduced_lumped  %>% 
  spread(key="SPP6", value="max_cover") 

#Replace NA values with 0

inner_wide[is.na(inner_wide)] <- 0 

#Make a separate dataframe for the labels
inner_wide.labs <- inner_wide[, c(1,2,3)]

#Turn our dataset into a matrix 
inner_wide_mat <- inner_wide[,-c(1,2,3)]


#Double check your work using the View() function.

#### Mean C - Model assumptions

Distribution of C values for all treatments were right skewed, indicating the majority of native plants in all treatments were of low conservatism value. Simultaneous seeding had the most "even" distribution of C values and almost every value was represented in this treatment. Across years, the largest changes in the distribution of C values were in the treatments that seeded the fall dispersing species in September. These changes were attributed to the replacement of species with low c values with more conservative species. Plots that were never seeded mainly consisted of species with low conservatism value. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Make a histogram showing the distribution of c values in each treatment

ggplot(data = C_hist, aes(x= C_Value, fill = Year)) +geom_density(bins =30, alpha =0.4) +facet_wrap(~Treatment) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 1))
```

Generally, mean C values were normally distributed with few extreme outliers, suggesting we can use a linear model to predict mean c as a function of treatment and year. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# A couple of outliers in the NAT treatment but likely alright since the variablity in outcomes seems to be a characteristic of NAT

# Only one extreme value in LE 2021 (likely because of DALCAN and VIOPED)

  group_by(Treatment, Year) %>%
  identify_outliers(Mean_C)


# Mean C fits a normal distribution

# Vast majority of points fall along the reference line

ggqqplot(Summary_table , "Mean_C", ggtheme = theme_bw()) +
  facet_grid(Year~ Treatment, labeller = "label_both")

```

#### Mean C - Model fitting


I used a linear model to predict mean c as a function of seeding treatment, year, and an interaction between treatment and year. A mixed model using block as a random effect produced a singular fit because the variance explained by the random effect block was estimated as close to zero and did not further inform the data. Therefore, I chose to use the simpler model. 

Model fit was high, with an adjusted $R^{2}$ value of 0.687. Also, residual plots did not reveal any concerning patterns.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}



# Dropped the mixed model due to singular fit -> the variance of the random effect block is estimated close to zero and does not further inform the data. 

Summary_table$Block <- as.factor(Summary_table$Block)

Summary_table$Treatment <- factor(Summary_table$Treatment, levels=c("LE", "LL", "NAT", "NON" , "SIM"))


# Normal interaction model

Mean_C.mod.lm.interaction <- lm(Mean_C~Treatment*Year, data =Summary_table)

## Summary results

summary(Mean_C.mod.lm.interaction)

```


```{r}
# Residual plot looks decent
plot(Mean_C.mod.lm.interaction)

```

Analysis of variance (type III) revealed that seeding treatment was the only significant factor influence mean c value. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## ANOVA type 3

Anova(Mean_C.mod.lm.interaction, type = 3)

```

Posthoc analysis indicated that all seeding treatments increased mean c value compared to unseeded plots. Seeding all species in one addition produced more conservative communities than treatments that seeded summer dispersing species first followed by fall dispersing species. Even though seeding only the fall dispersing species first produced higher quality communities than those that seeded species with natural timing, there was no difference in mean c between the seeding treatments that had two lumped additions. 

```{r}
Mean_C.mod.lm.est <- lm(Mean_C~Treatment, data =Summary_table)


est.lm.treatment_treatment <- emmeans::emmeans(Mean_C.mod.lm.est, ~ Treatment, type = "response")

pairs(est.lm.treatment_treatment, adjust = "tukey")


#Posthoc test
#est.lm.treatment <- emmeans::emmeans(Mean_C.mod.lm.interaction, ~ Treatment*Year, type = "response")

#pairs(est.lm.treatment, adjust = "tukey")

```

Overall, seeding fall dispersing species early either as part of one simultaneous or as two lumped additions produced the highest quality communities.

### Species Richness {.tabset}


SIM treatments had the greatest species richness compared to all other treatments, while NON and NAT had the lowest. 

#### SR - Model assumptions

Overall, species richness follows a normal distribution despite being count data. There were a couple of outliers in the natural seeding treatment but this is likely alright. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# A couple of outliers in the NAT treatment but likely alright since the variability in outcomes seems to be a characteristic of NAT

Summary_table %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Year) %>%
  identify_outliers(Species_richness)


# Species richness fits a normal distribution

Summary_table %>%
  group_by(Treatment, Year) %>%
  shapiro_test(Species_richness)

ggplot(data = Summary_table, aes(x= Species_richness)) +geom_histogram(bins =15) 


# Vast majority of points fall along the reference line

ggqqplot(Summary_table, "Species_richness", ggtheme = theme_bw()) +
  facet_grid(Year~ Treatment, labeller = "label_both")


```


#### SR - Model fitting

I chose to use a linear mixed-effects model with block as a random effect to predict species richness as a function of seeding treatment, year, and an interaction between treatment and year. Despite being count data, the distribution of species richness is remarkably balanced and not skewed. Model comparison using AIC revealed that the Normal model performed better than the Poisson model, which was underdispersed. A more complicated Quasipoisson model that accounted for underdispersion produced similar results to the Normal mixed model. Therefore, I chose to use the less complicated Normal model.

Overall, model fit was decent. For example, $R^{2}_{GLMM(m)}$ (i.e., the variance explained by only the fixed effects) was 0.474 and $R^{2}_{GLMM(c)}$ (i.e., variance explained by the entire model) was 0.598. Inclusion of the random effect block substantially improved model fit. Furthermore, there were no strange patterns or occurrences in the model residuals.  


```{r, echo = FALSE,  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Model Fitting


SR.mod.normal <- lmer(Species_richness~Treatment*Year+(1|Block), data =Summary_table)
summary(SR.mod.normal)

## Marginal R^2 (variance explained by ONLY fixed effects) = 0.47437
## Conditional R^2 (variance explained by the entire model) = 0.5975126

## Inclusion of the random effect increased model fit 


r.squaredGLMM(SR.mod.normal)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# Residual plot looks decent except for one large outlier
plot(SR.mod.normal)

```

A type III ANOVA revealed significant differences in species richness between years and seeding treatments. However, there was no significant interactive effect between year and seeding treatment on species richness. 

Seeding treatments that added species either in one or two lumped additions had significantly greater species richness than unseeded plots. Multiple seedings according to natural dispersal activity did not increase species richness compared to unseeded plots.  Adding the entire species pool simultaneously produced communities with the greatest species richness.  Treatments that conducted multiple seedings resulted in communities possessing similar amounts of species richness regardless of timing and order of species arrival. 

```{r, echo = FALSE,  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

## Treatment and Year significant
## Interaction between Treatment and Year not significant

Anova(SR.mod.normal, type = 3)


SR.mod.normal.est <- lmer(Species_richness~Treatment+(1|Block), data =Summary_table)

### fit a distance-based RDA 
#### Allows you to do a constrained ordination using non-Euclidean distance measures such as Bray-curtis dissimilarity (which is fitting for our data on plant communities)

#### it works by: 1) making the distance matrix based on your desired measure, 2) doing a PCoA, 3) taking the PCoA eigenvectors and putting them into an RDA.


### Use the capscale function (not the dbRDA since it doesn't provide species scores)
dbRDA <- capscale(inner.hel.2023 ~ Treatment, data = env.data.2023,  dist="bray", add = TRUE)

## dbRDA results
dbRDA

## PERMANOVA results
anova(dbRDA, step = 1000, by = "terms", permu = 999)
